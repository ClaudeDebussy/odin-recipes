            <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>A simple, traditional recipe for Uzbek black tea (chorny chai)—a central part of Uzbek hospitality, typically served strong, hot, and without milk, often in a small bowl called a piyola.</p>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 tablespoon loose-leaf black tea (e.g. Ceylon or Chinese black tea)</li>
                    <li>3 cups (700 ml) water</li>
                    <li><em>Opetional:</em> lemon slices, sugar, or dried apricots for serving</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Boil the water in a kettle or saucepan.</li>
                    <li>Warm the teapot by rinsing it with a small amount of hot water and discarding it.</li>
                    <li>Add loose tea leaves to the warm teapot (about 1 tsp per person).</li>
                    <li>Pour boiling water over the tea leaves. Cover and steep for 3-5 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Traditional Uzbek method: Pour tea into a piyola (tea bowl), then back into the teapot—repeat 2-3 times to mix and aerate.</li>
                    <li>Serve immediately in small bowls or cups, optionally with sugar, lemon slices, or sweets on the side.</li>
                </ol>
